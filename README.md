This repository contains source code, documentation, and R data for the project "phytools 2.0: an updated R ecosystem for phylogenetic comparative methods (and other things)."

The development version of *phytools* can be most easily installed using the *remotes* package as follows:

```
remotes::install_github("liamrevell/phytools")
```

Comments & pull requests are welcome; however, those not involving *actual software bugs* (which I always try to fix as promptly as I can) may not always be addressed in a timely manner.
